        <h2>First post</h2>
        <p>
            I’m Tarek Abounaheya, an enthusiastic IT developer passionate about turning code into creativity through web design. From my first steps with HTML and CSS to ongoing projects, I see every challenge as a chance to grow, create, and connect.

            Web development has become more than just a skill—it’s a personal journey where curiosity fuels innovation and every project tells a story. HTML and CSS opened my eyes to the structure and style behind every webpage, showing me how simple code can shape powerful, responsive designs.

        <p> I’m genuinely excited to be studying HTML and CSS, and I can’t wait to keep learning, building, and pushing the limits of what I can create.</p>
        
        <h2>Second post</h2>
        <p>
            Completing my HTML and CSS course has opened up a world of possibilities I couldn’t have imagined before. What started as curiosity has grown into a clear direction—I now see web design not just as a skill, but as a pathway to shape digital experiences that matter.

            With a solid grasp of structure and style, my next step is learning JavaScript to bring interactivity and functionality to my websites. I plan to build a personal portfolio from scratch, showcasing my projects and design style, while also experimenting with real-world layouts, animations, and responsive frameworks like Flexbox and Grid.

        <p> In the future, I aim to take on freelance web design projects, contribute to open-source work, and eventually develop full-stack skills so I can create complete, user-centered web applications. The journey is just beginning, but I’m excited to keep learning, keep experimenting, and bring bold, thoughtful ideas to life on the web.
